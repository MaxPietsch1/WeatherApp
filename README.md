# Weather app

What we will be buildning?
we will build an app that displays the weather, when the user inputs a city or country.
We will make a request to openweathermap API and then use the response to display the data on the browser.

We will be using Node to run our server.

# How to run the project

start the server on port 8000 and be sure to be in the root folder.

```
$ node server.js
```
